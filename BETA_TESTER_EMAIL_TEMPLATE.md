## EMAIL TEMPLATE (Copy & Paste):

```
Subject: 🚀 Quick favor - test my new AI terminal? (5 mins max!)

Hey [Name]!

Hope you're doing well! I've been working on something cool and would love your quick feedback.

I built RinaWarp Terminal - an AI-powered terminal that makes developers way more productive. Think of it like having a smart assistant for your command line.

**🎯 What it does:**
🤖 Smart command suggestions based on what you're doing
⚡ Automated Git workflows (no more forgetting git commands!)
🎨 Beautiful themes that don't hurt your eyes
☁️ Syncs your settings across computers

**🧪 TEST IT NOW (No signup, no payment, 30-second download):**
https://rinawrapterminal.netlify.app/RinaWarp-Terminal-Portable.exe

Just download, run, and try typing a few commands. The AI kicks in automatically!

**⏰ What I need (honestly just 5 minutes):**
1. Download and open it
2. Try typing "git status" or "npm install" 
3. See if the AI suggestions make sense
4. Let me know: Does it feel useful? Confusing? Buggy?

**💬 Quick feedback questions:**
- Does it install/run okay on your computer?
- Are the AI suggestions helpful or annoying?
- Would you actually use this for real work?
- Any bugs or weird behavior?
- What's your honest first impression?

No pressure if you're swamped - I know everyone's busy! But if you have 5 minutes, your feedback would be incredibly valuable.

Planning to launch this soon, so any early insights from a fellow developer would be amazing.

Thanks!
[Your name]

P.S. If you hate it, please tell me honestly! Better to know now than after launch 😅

Hey [Name]!

Just following up on the terminal testing thing - totally understand if you're swamped and haven't had a chance!

If you do get 5 minutes to try it out, the link is still:
https://rinawrapterminal.netlify.app/RinaWarp-Terminal-Portable.exe

But no pressure at all. I know how crazy things get.

Either way, hope you're doing well!

## PERSONALIZATION TIPS:

**For Close Friends:**
- Start with "Hey buddy!" or their nickname
- Add personal context: "Remember that terminal project I mentioned?"
- Be more casual: "Wanna be my guinea pig for 5 minutes?"

**For Professional Contacts:**
- Use "Hi [Name]" 
- Add context: "Hope the new job is going well!"
- More formal: "I'd appreciate your professional perspective"

**For Developer Friends:**
- Technical details: "Built with Electron, uses OpenAI API"
- Developer pain points: "You know how annoying git workflows can be..."
- Geek out: "The AI integration is actually pretty clever"

**For Non-Developer Friends:**
- Simplify: "It's like autocomplete for programmers"
- Add context: "You know how I'm always typing commands? This makes it smarter"
- Focus on the cool factor: "It's got AI built right in!"
