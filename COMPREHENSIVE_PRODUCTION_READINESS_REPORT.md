- **Resolution:** Updated to use modern Sentry v8+ API with proper error handling
- **Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Sentry error tracking now enabled

### 2. **Environment Variables** ✅
- **Issue:** Missing Stripe price keys locally
- **Resolution:** Synchronized local `.env` with Railway environment variables
- **Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - All 6/6 Stripe price keys configured

### 3. **Server Dependencies** ✅
- **Issue:** Missing critical dependencies (morgan, etc.)
- **Resolution:** All production dependencies installed and verified
- **Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Server starts without dependency errors

### 4. **Security Vulnerabilities** ✅
- **Issue:** npm audit vulnerabilities
- **Resolution:** No vulnerabilities found in current state

## ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUES TO FIX**

### 1. **Jest Testing System** ❌ **CRITICAL**
- **Issue:** `babel-jest` module not found error
- **Impact:** Cannot run automated tests
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Fix Required:** 
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-jest
  ```

### 2. **Railway Deployment** ❌ **CRITICAL**
- **Issue:** App returns 404 on deployed Railway URLs
- **Impact:** Cannot access production site
- **Priority:** **CRITICAL** for revenue generation
- **Status:** Environment variables set, but app not responding
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Check Railway build logs manually via dashboard
  - Verify port configuration (should use `process.env.PORT`)
  - Test deployment with minimal configuration

### 3. **Project File Bloat** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**
- **Issue:** 527 files in root directory, many duplicates/deprecated
- **Impact:** Slower deployments, confusion, maintenance overhead
- **Size:** ~5.4GB total project size (reduced to 1.3GB after cleanup)
- **Recommendation:** Clean up deprecated files and consolidate structure

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Fix Jest Testing** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Clean and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Install missing babel dependencies
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-jest

# Test the fix
npm test -- --passWithNoTests
```

### **Step 2: Fix Railway Deployment** (60 minutes)
1. **Check Railway Dashboard:**
   - Visit Railway web dashboard
   - Check build logs for deployment failures
   - Verify service is properly configured

2. **Debug Port Configuration:**
   ```javascript
   // Verify server.js uses correct port
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
   app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => { ... });
   ```

3. **Test Minimal Deployment:**
   - Create minimal test server
   - Deploy to Railway to isolate issues
   - Gradually add complexity

### **Step 3: Clean Up Project Structure** (120 minutes)
```bash
# Use the smart file manager to clean duplicates
npm run clean:smart

# Remove deprecated files
rm -rf backup-*
rm -rf deprecated/
rm -rf temp-*

# Organize assets properly
```
