# 🌊 RinaWarp Website Maintenance Guide

## 🎯 Purpose
This guide ensures the RinaWarp website (rinawarptech.com) remains stable, secure, and issue-free.

## 🔧 Automated Systems

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash

- Content consistency
- Security settings
- Server functionality
```

### 2. Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Start the monitoring service
node website-monitor.js

# Or use as a service:
sudo systemctl start rinawarp-monitor
```

### 3. Auto-Maintenance
```bash
# Run daily (set up cron job)
node auto-maintenance.js

# Cron job setup:
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/rinawarp-terminal && node auto-maintenance.js >> logs/maintenance.log 2>&1
```

## 📋 Daily Checklist

### Morning (9 AM)
- [ ] Check website-health.log for overnight issues
- [ ] Verify all payment endpoints are responding

node website-monitor.js

# Check for large files
find public -type f -size +1M
```

### 4. Pricing Inconsistency
```bash

npm run deploy:railway

# Or manual deployment
git push origin main
```
