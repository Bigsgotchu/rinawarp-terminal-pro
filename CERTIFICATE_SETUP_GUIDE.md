## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configure Certificates in Project**

### **Update package.json**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "win": {
      "certificateFile": "certs/windows-certificate.p12",
      "certificatePassword": "env:WIN_CERT_PASSWORD",
      "publisherName": "Your Business Name",

# Add certs/ to .gitignore
```

### **Update .gitignore**
```gitignore
# Certificates and secrets
certs/
*.p12
*.pfx
*.key
.env

```

### **Test macOS Signing** (on Mac)
```bash
# Test sign an app bundle
codesign --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name" --timestamp MyApp.app

# Verify signature
codesign --verify --verbose MyApp.app
spctl --assess --verbose MyApp.app
```

### **Test Linux Signing**
```bash
# Test sign a file
