# 🚂 Railway Backup Deployment Control

## Status
- **Current Status**: ACTIVE ⚠️ (as backup only)
- **URL**: https://rinawarp-terminal-production-adfe.up.railway.app/
- **Primary Purpose**: Emergency backup for rinawarptech.com

## Manual Control Commands

### To temporarily stop Railway deployment:
```bash
railway down
```

### To restart Railway deployment:
```bash
railway up
```

### To check Railway status:
```bash
railway status
```

## Deployment Strategy
- **Primary**: rinawarptech.com (manual deployment)
- **Backup**: Railway (kept running but not actively deployed to)
- **Removed**: Automated Railway deployments from `deploy-trigger.js`

## Emergency Recovery Process
If rinawarptech.com fails:

1. **Immediate**: Railway is already running at the backup URL
2. **Update DNS**: Point domain to Railway if needed
3. **Reactivate**: Restore Railway functions in deploy-trigger.js if needed

## Important Notes
- 🔄 Railway is NOT automatically deployed to anymore
- 🏠 It remains as a running backup service
- 🚫 Do not manually shut down Railway unless emergency
- ✅ Primary focus is rinawarptech.com deployment

## Current Railway Configuration
- **Project**: Rinawarp Terminal Enterprise
- **Environment**: production  
- **Service**: rinawarp-terminal
- **Purpose**: Backup/failover only
