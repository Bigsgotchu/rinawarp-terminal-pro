# Final deployment sequence that worked:
railway up                          # Deploy to Railway
railway status                      # Check deployment status  
railway domain                      # Verify domain configuration
railway logs                        # Monitor deployment logs
```

## 📝 Key Configuration Files

- **package.json** - Simplified with essential dependencies only
- **railway.json** - Optimized for web deployment
- **server.js** - Minimal stable server implementation
- **.env** - Environment variables (not committed)
