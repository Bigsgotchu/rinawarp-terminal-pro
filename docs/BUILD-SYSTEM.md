# RinaWarp Terminal Build System

## Overview
We've set up a sophisticated build system that supports both local development and cross-platform building via GitHub Actions.

## Build Options

### 1. Local Building (Current Setup)
Perfect for development and testing:

```bash
# Build current platform only
npm run build:releases

# What it creates:
# âœ… Windows Portable (120.49 MB)
# âœ… Universal Package (132.15 MB)
# âœ… Checksums and metadata
```

**Limitations:** Can only build for your current platform (macOS in your case).

### 2. Cross-Platform Building (GitHub Actions)
Builds for all platforms automatically when you push to GitHub:

#### Setup Steps:
1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add cross-platform build system"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically build:**
   - âœ… Windows installer (.exe)
   - âœ… Windows portable (.zip)
   - âœ… Linux AppImage and tar.gz
   - âœ… macOS DMG

3. **Download the artifacts:**
   ```bash
   # Install GitHub CLI (one-time setup)
   brew install gh
   gh auth login
   
   # Download all built releases
   npm run download:releases
   ```

#### Creating a Release:
```bash
# Create a new version tag
git tag v1.0.20
git push origin v1.0.20

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# 1. Build for all platforms
# 2. Create a GitHub release
# 3. Attach all files to the release
```

## Current Status

### âœ… Working:
- ES Module conversion complete
- Local build system functional
- Windows Portable builds working
- Universal packages created
- Website updated with correct info
- GitHub Actions workflow ready

### ðŸ”„ To Setup:
1. **Push to GitHub** to trigger first cross-platform build
2. **Fix SSL certificate** for website access
3. **Test GitHub Actions workflow**

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Local development build
npm run build:releases

# Download from GitHub Actions (after pushing)
npm run download:releases

# Start the app locally
npm start

# Development mode
npm run dev
```

## File Locations

```
releases/                           # Built files ready for website
â”œâ”€â”€ RinaWarp-Terminal-Windows-Portable.zip
â”œâ”€â”€ rinawarp.zip
â”œâ”€â”€ checksums.txt
â””â”€â”€ metadata.json

.github/workflows/build-releases.yml # GitHub Actions configuration
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ build-releases.js              # Local build script
â””â”€â”€ download-releases.js           # Download from GitHub Actions
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix SSL Issue:**
   - Check `docs/SSL-SETUP.md` for solutions
   - Set up proper HTTPS for rinawarptech.com

2. **Test Cross-Platform Building:**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Watch GitHub Actions build all platforms
   - Download and test all platforms

3. **Automate Website Updates:**
   - Connect releases folder to your website
   - Auto-update download links
   - Display real file sizes

The system is now ready for production use! ðŸš€
