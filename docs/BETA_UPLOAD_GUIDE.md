## 📧 **Ready-to-Use Email Template**

Once you have your download links:

```
Subject: 🧪 Quick favor? Beta test my AI terminal (5 mins?)

Hey [Name]!

Hope you're doing well! I've been working on something cool and could use 5 minutes of your developer brain.

I built an AI-powered terminal called RinaWarp Terminal and it's ready for beta testing. Think Windows Terminal meets GitHub Copilot.

🤖 AI command suggestions as you type
⚡ Smart Git workflow automation
🎨 Beautiful themes (including a mermaid theme!)
☁️ Cloud sync across devices

Would you mind giving it a quick test? Literally 5 minutes:

📦 **Download (Installer):** [YOUR_INSTALLER_LINK]
📦 **Download (Portable):** [YOUR_PORTABLE_LINK]
📝 **Feedback Form:** https://forms.gle/CfAwr634VdA9pXQG8

No pressure if you're swamped - just thought you might find it interesting since you work with terminals daily.

As a thank you, you'll get 50% off if I end up selling it + early access to new features.

Thanks!
[Your name]

P.S. If it crashes or breaks, that's perfect feedback too! 😄
```

## ⚠️ **About Those Console Warnings**

I noticed these warnings when you ran the app:
- `Duplicate export of 'WorkflowAutomationEngine'`
- `No features registered in integration system`

These are **NOT critical** for beta testing - the app still works! But you might want to mention in your beta feedback form that you're aware of some console warnings.
