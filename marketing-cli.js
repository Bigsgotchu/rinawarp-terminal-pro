    body: `Hi HN!

I've been working on RinaWarp Terminal for the past year - an AI-powered terminal that actually understands what you're trying to do.

Key features:
• AI command suggestions based on context
• Voice control - speak commands naturally
• Cloud sync across all your devices
• Beautiful, customizable themes
• Enterprise security and team collaboration

The inspiration came from watching developers (including myself) constantly googling terminal commands and copying configs between machines. We thought: what if the terminal could just... know what you want to do?

The AI component uses natural language processing to understand intent and suggest commands. For example, you can say "find all JavaScript files modified this week" and it translates that to the appropriate find/grep commands.

Voice control was surprisingly challenging - we had to build custom speech recognition that understands developer terminology and handles background noise in typical dev environments.

Start free: https://rinawarptech.com

Technical details:
• Built with Node.js and Electron
• Uses OpenAI for natural language processing
• Custom speech recognition engine
• End-to-end encryption for cloud sync
• Plugin architecture for extensibility

Happy to answer any questions about the technical implementation or design decisions!`,

      title: 'Built an AI-powered terminal with voice control - thoughts?',
      body: `Hey r/programming!

I've spent the last year building RinaWarp Terminal, and I'd love to get your thoughts on it.

The core idea: what if your terminal could understand natural language and respond to voice commands?

Features that might interest you:
• AI suggests commands as you type (context-aware)
• Voice control - "find all Python files modified today"
• Cloud sync keeps your configs everywhere
• Collaborative features for team development
• Plugin system for custom extensions

Technical stack:
• Node.js/Electron for cross-platform support
• Custom speech recognition engine
• OpenAI integration for command translation
• End-to-end encryption for cloud features

The hardest part was making the AI suggestions actually useful rather than annoying. We trained it on common developer workflows and it learns your patterns over time.

What do you think? Would you use voice control in your terminal? What features am I missing?

Open to all feedback - technical, UX, or business model!`,

      body: `Terminal enthusiasts of Reddit!

Just launched RinaWarp Terminal and wanted to share it with the community that appreciates good terminal tools.

What makes it different:
• Voice commands that actually work (no more typing long paths)
• AI that suggests commands based on your current context
• Cloud sync without compromising privacy (E2E encrypted)
• Themes that don't suck
• Proper collaboration features for teams

I know we're all picky about our terminals, so I made sure it:
✅ Doesn't mess with your existing configs
✅ Works with all your favorite tools (zsh, fish, etc.)
✅ Has proper keyboard shortcuts (vim users, I got you)
✅ Stays out of your way when you don't need it
