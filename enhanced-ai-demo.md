## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. **Activation**

The Enhanced AI system loads automatically when you open the terminal. Look for these status messages:

```
üöÄ Initializing Enhanced Development Assistant...
‚úÖ Enhanced Development Assistant initialized (LLM: Available)
üß† Enhanced AI Development Assistant ready!
```

### 2. **Enhanced Mode Toggle**

Use the "üß† Enhanced Mode" button in the controls to toggle between enhanced and basic AI modes.

### 3. **Quick Access Buttons**

- **üîç Quick Analysis**: Opens a prompt for code analysis requests
- **‚ö° Generate**: Opens a prompt for program generation requests
- **üß† Enhanced Mode**: Toggles enhanced AI capabilities on/off

### 4. **Direct Input**

Type your requests directly in the AI input field. The system automatically detects when to use enhanced capabilities based on keywords and context.

## üìã Enhanced Command Patterns

The system recognizes these patterns for enhanced processing:

### Code Analysis Triggers
- `analyze.*code`
- `review.*code`
- `check.*code`
- `examine.*code`
- `what does.*code`

### Debugging Triggers
- `debug`, `fix`, `error`, `bug`, `issue`
- `why.*not.*work`
- `what.*wrong`
- `exception`, `stack trace`

### Program Generation Triggers
- `create.*program`
- `write.*code`
- `build.*app`
- `generate.*function`
- `make.*component`

### Architecture Triggers
- `architecture`, `design`, `structure`
- `how.*organize`
- `best.*approach`
- `scalable`, `maintainable`

### Explanation Triggers
- `explain`, `how.*work`, `what.*is`
- `difference between`
- `concept`, `principle`

## üé® Response Features

### Confidence Scoring
Each response includes a confidence percentage indicating the AI's certainty about the answer.

### Source Attribution
Responses show whether they came from:
- Enhanced LLM analysis
- Local pattern matching
- Template generation
- Knowledge base

### Interactive Code Execution
When the AI generates code, you'll be prompted to:
1. Save the code to a file
2. Execute it directly (if it's a script)
3. Copy it to your clipboard

### Contextual Suggestions
The system provides relevant follow-up suggestions based on your request and the response.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### LLM Provider Setup
Access AI configuration through the "üß† AI Config" button:

1. **Provider Selection**: Choose from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local Ollama
2. **API Key Configuration**: Enter your API keys for external providers
3. **Connection Testing**: Verify your configuration works
4. **Mode Switching**: Toggle between hybrid, LLM-only, learning, or local modes

### Context Gathering
The system automatically gathers context including:
- Current directory and file structure
- Git repository status
- Recent command history
- Project dependencies
- Environment information

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. **Be Specific**
Instead of "analyze code", try "analyze this React component for performance bottlenecks and accessibility issues"

### 2. **Provide Context**
Mention the programming language, framework, and any specific constraints or requirements

### 3. **Use Natural Language**
The system understands natural language well, so speak normally:
- "Can you help me debug this error I'm getting?"
- "I need a Python function that validates email addresses"
- "What's the best way to structure a Node.js API?"

### 4. **Iterative Development**
Build on previous responses:
- "Can you add error handling to the previous function?"
- "Now make it work with TypeScript"
- "Add unit tests for this code"

### 5. **Leverage Code Execution**
When the AI generates code:
- Test it immediately using the execution feature
- Save useful snippets for later use
- Modify and iterate based on results

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Full Development Workflow

1. **Architecture Planning**
   ```

   ```
   generate unit tests for the authentication module
   ```

5. **Documentation**
   ```
   write API documentation for these endpoints
   ```

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Error Analysis**
   ```
   debug this error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of null
   ```

2. **Root Cause Investigation**
   ```
   explain why this error occurs in React components
   ```

3. **Fix Implementation**
   ```
   write a defensive version of this function that handles null values
   ```
