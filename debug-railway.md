# 🔧 Railway Deployment Debug Guide

## Current Issue: Railway Serving Default Page

Your Railway app at `https://rinawarp-terminal-production.railway.app/` is showing:
```
✨ Home of the Railway API ✨
```

This means Railway is **NOT** running your Node.js application.

---

## 🔍 Debug Steps

### 1. Check Railway Dashboard
- Go to https://railway.app
- Open your RinaWarp Terminal project
- Click **"Deployments"** tab
- Look for recent deployment logs
- Check for build errors or failures

### 2. Check Build Logs
Look for these in Railway logs:
- ✅ `npm ci --omit=optional --omit=dev` (install step)
- ✅ `echo 'Build phase - RinaWarp Terminal debug server ready'` (build step)
- ✅ `node railway-debug.js` (start command)

### 3. Expected Success Logs
If working, you should see:
```
🔧 Railway Debug Server Starting...
📡 Port: [RAILWAY_PORT]
🌍 Environment: production
📅 Started at: [TIMESTAMP]
🚀 Railway Debug Server running on port [RAILWAY_PORT]
🌐 URL: http://0.0.0.0:[RAILWAY_PORT]
✅ Server ready to accept connections
```

### 4. Common Railway Issues

#### Issue A: Build Failure
- **Symptoms**: No application logs in Railway
- **Fix**: Check package.json dependencies, remove problematic imports
- **Test**: Simplify nixpacks.toml

#### Issue B: Wrong Start Command
- **Symptoms**: Build succeeds but app doesn't start
- **Fix**: Verify start command matches file name
- **Current**: `node railway-debug.js`

#### Issue C: Port Issues
- **Symptoms**: App starts but Railway can't connect
- **Fix**: Ensure app listens on `process.env.PORT`
- **Current**: Our debug server uses `process.env.PORT || 8080`

#### Issue D: Module Import Issues
- **Symptoms**: Build succeeds but crashes on start
- **Fix**: Check ES modules vs CommonJS compatibility
- **Status**: Using ES modules (`import` statements)

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Simplify Nixpacks Config
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_22"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["npm install --production"]

[phases.start]
cmd = "node railway-debug.js"
```

### Fix 2: Add Railway-specific Procfile
Create `Procfile`:
```
web: node railway-debug.js
```

### Fix 3: Test Locally First
```bash
# Test the debug server locally
PORT=3000 node railway-debug.js
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## 📊 What We're Testing

Our debug server should respond with:
```json
{
  "message": "RinaWarp Terminal is LIVE on Railway!",
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T00:20:00.000Z",
  "port": "8080",
  "environment": "production",
  "server": "railway-debug"
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Check Railway Dashboard** - Look for deployment errors
2. **Review Build Logs** - Identify where deployment fails  
3. **Test Debug Server Locally** - Ensure it works before deploying
4. **Switch Back to Main Server** - Once debug server works
