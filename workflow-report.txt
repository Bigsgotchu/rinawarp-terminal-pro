🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 CRITICAL: High failure rate detected!
⚠️  WARNING: Moderate failure rate


• Monitor workflows with >50% failure rate
• Check for missing secrets in deployment workflows
• Review dependency conflicts in build workflows
• Consider workflow optimization for long-running jobs

📈 TREND ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Recent improvements should show:
• Reduced CodeQL failures (updated to v3 actions)
• Better dependency handling (--legacy-peer-deps)
• Improved linting resilience (non-blocking)
• Enhanced build performance
