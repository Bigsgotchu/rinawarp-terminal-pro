Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Just launched my side project - RinaWarp Terminal! ðŸš€

It's an AI-powered terminal that understands voice commands and automates repetitive tasks. Think of it as having an AI assistant for your command line.

Free download: https://rinawarptech.com

Would love your feedback if anyone wants to try it out! Built it because I got tired of typing the same git/npm/docker commands over and over.

Features:
â€¢ Voice commands â†’ terminal actions  
â€¢ Smart automation suggestions
â€¢ Cross-platform support

Still early days but excited to share with the dev community! ðŸŽ‰
