Stop memorizing complex commands! 

Traditional: `find . -name "*.js" -type f -exec grep -l "function" {} \;`

RinaWarp: `rina "find JavaScript files with functions"`

Same result. Way more intuitive. 🧜‍♀️

### **r/programming**
**Title:** I built an AI terminal that understands natural language and responds to voice commands [OC]

```
After 8 months of development, I'm excited to share RinaWarp Terminal v1.3.1!

**What makes it special:**
- Natural language commands: "show me all JavaScript files modified today"
- Voice control: "Hey Rina, check my Git status" 
- 6 beautiful themes including underwater Mermaid Magic 🧜‍♀️
- Sub-millisecond command execution
- Enterprise-grade security with local data processing

**Key features:**
- AI assistant that learns your workflow
- Cross-platform (macOS available now, Windows/Linux coming soon)
- Free tier with core features
- Premium tiers with advanced AI and team collaboration

**Why I built this:**
Traditional terminals require memorizing hundreds of commands. RinaWarp lets you just describe what you want in plain English. It's like having a pair-programming partner who never judges your command-line fumbles.

**Example:** Instead of `find . -name "*.js" -type f -exec grep -l "function" {} \;`
Just type: `rina "find JavaScript files with functions"`

The free version includes basic terminal features, 3 tabs, 6 themes, and basic AI. Premium plans add voice control, cloud sync, and team features.

### **r/MacOS**
**Title:** New AI-powered terminal for macOS with voice control and beautiful themes

```
Just released RinaWarp Terminal v1.3.1 for macOS! 

**macOS-specific features:**
- Native macOS app with proper window controls
- Integrates with macOS keychain for secure API key storage
- Optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon (coming soon)
- Beautiful themes that complement macOS design language

**Installation is simple:**
1. Download from GitHub releases
2. Extract and move to Applications
3. Grant mic permissions for voice control
4. Start with "rina 'show me system info'"

The app is built with Electron but feels native. Memory usage stays around 45MB even with multiple tabs open.

**Free version includes:**
- All core terminal features
- 3 tabs and split panes
- 6 professional themes
- Basic AI assistant

**Premium features ($15/month):**
- Advanced AI with context awareness  
- Full voice control ("Hey Rina" commands)
- Cloud sync across devices
- Priority support

Download: https://github.com/Bigsgotchu/rinawarp-terminal-pro/releases/latest

Any macOS-specific features you'd like to see? Planning Touch Bar support and Shortcuts integration.

### **r/commandline**
**Title:** RinaWarp Terminal: AI assistant that converts natural language to terminal commands

```
Fellow command-line enthusiasts! I've been working on something that might interest you.

**The problem:** We all know the pain of forgetting command syntax, especially for complex operations across different tools (git, docker, aws cli, etc.).

**The solution:** RinaWarp Terminal with AI that understands what you want to do and suggests the right commands.

**Examples:**
- "show files larger than 100MB" → `find . -size +100M -type f -ls`
- "kill processes using port 3000" → `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`
- "show git commits from last week" → `git log --since="1 week ago" --oneline`

**Why it's different:**
- Runs locally with your preferred shell (bash, zsh, fish)
- Learns your command patterns and aliases
- Supports voice control for accessibility
- Works with existing dotfiles and configurations
- Free tier doesn't require signup or API keys

**Privacy:** Basic AI runs locally. Advanced features use encrypted API calls but never send sensitive data like file contents or environment variables.

The AI suggests commands but you always confirm before execution. No automatic command running.

**Download:** https://github.com/Bigsgotchu/rinawarp-terminal-pro/releases/latest

Currently macOS only, but Windows/Linux builds coming via automated pipeline.
