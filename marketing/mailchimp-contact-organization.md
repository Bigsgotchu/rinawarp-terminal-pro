# Mailchimp Contact Organization Strategy
## RinaWarp Terminal Launch Campaign

### Current Situation
- Starting with 4 existing subscribers
- Goal: Grow to 50+ subscribers before/during launch
- Multiple contact sources to consolidate
- Need unified audience management

## 1. Single Audience Strategy (Recommended)

**Why One Audience?**
- Easier to manage and maintain
- Better for personalization and segmentation
- Prevents duplicate contacts across lists
- Simpler automation setup
- Cost-effective (Mailchimp charges per contact, not per list)

### Audience Name: "RinaWarp Terminal Users & Prospects"

## 2. Contact Segmentation Tags

Use Mailchimp tags to organize contacts instead of separate lists:

### Primary Source Tags
- `source-existing` (your current 4 subscribers)
- `source-personal-network` (friends, family, colleagues)
- `source-github` (GitHub followers/connections)
- `source-reddit` (Reddit community outreach)
- `source-discord` (Discord community outreach)
- `source-linkedin` (LinkedIn connections)
- `source-website` (organic website signups)
- `source-launch-day` (launch day signups)

### Interest Level Tags
- `interest-high` (very engaged, likely early adopters)
- `interest-medium` (interested but need nurturing)
- `interest-low` (general interest, long-term prospects)

### User Type Tags
- `type-developer` (professional developers)
- `type-student` (students, learning to code)
- `type-manager` (engineering managers, CTOs)
- `type-personal` (friends, family, non-tech)
- `type-enterprise` (enterprise decision makers)

### Company Size Tags
- `company-individual` (freelancers, solo developers)
- `company-startup` (1-20 employees)
- `company-small` (21-100 employees)
- `company-medium` (101-500 employees)
- `company-large` (500+ employees)

### Engagement Tags
- `engaged-high` (opens emails, clicks links)
- `engaged-medium` (opens emails regularly)
- `engaged-low` (minimal engagement)
- `beta-participant` (signed up for beta)
- `launch-supporter` (promoted launch to others)

## 3. Contact Import Strategy

### Step 1: Prepare Master Contact File
Create a single CSV with all contacts from your existing files.

**Required Columns:**
```csv
email,first_name,last_name,source,interest_level,user_type,company,company_size,notes,signup_date,last_contact
```

### Step 2: Import Process
1. **Clean existing 4 subscribers**: Export current list, add tags
2. **Add personal network contacts**: From your tracking template
3. **Add prospect contacts**: From your beta campaign template
4. **Remove duplicates**: Mailchimp will handle this automatically

### Step 3: Tag Assignment During Import
Use Mailchimp's tag assignment feature to automatically tag contacts during import based on source file.

## 4. Custom Fields Setup

Add these custom fields in Mailchimp for better personalization:

### Contact Info Fields
- `COMPANY` (text)
- `JOB_TITLE` (text)
- `GITHUB_USERNAME` (text)
- `TIMEZONE` (dropdown)

### Preference Fields
- `PREFERRED_CONTACT_TIME` (dropdown: morning/afternoon/evening)
- `TECHNICAL_LEVEL` (dropdown: beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert)
- `PRIMARY_USE_CASE` (text)

### Tracking Fields
- `REFERRAL_SOURCE` (text)
- `LAST_INTERACTION_DATE` (date)
- `BETA_INTEREST` (dropdown: high/medium/low/none)
- `LAUNCH_SUPPORTER` (yes/no)

## 5. Import File Templates

### Template A: Personal Network Contacts
```csv
email,first_name,last_name,source,interest_level,user_type,company,notes
john@example.com,John,Doe,personal-network,high,developer,TechCorp,Former colleague excited about AI tools
jane@example.com,Jane,Smith,personal-network,medium,manager,StartupXYZ,Engineering manager at startup
```

### Template B: Existing Subscribers
```csv

existing2@example.com,User,Two,existing,high,developer,2024-01-02,Early subscriber
```

## 6. Segmentation Strategy for Campaigns

### Launch Announcement Segments
1. **VIP Early Supporters** (source-existing + interest-high)
2. **Developer Network** (type-developer + source-personal-network)
3. **Cold Prospects** (source-reddit OR source-discord OR source-github)
4. **Enterprise Contacts** (type-manager OR company-medium OR company-large)

### Follow-up Segments
1. **Non-openers** (didn't open launch email)
2. **Clicked but didn't download** (engaged but need push)
3. **Downloaded** (converted, send retention emails)
