# 🧜‍♀️ RinaWarp Terminal Website Setup Guide

## 🎯 Current Situation: Setting up rinawarptech.com

Great choice using Wix! Here's how to set up your RinaWarp Terminal website for maximum conversion and launch success.

- Tech startup templates
- Developer tool pages

### Step 3: Manual Brand Setup (If Import Doesn't Work)

#### Upload Your Logos:
1. **Header Logo**: Use `rinawarp-logo-primary.svg`
2. **Footer Logo**: Use `rinawarp-mermaid-logo-v2.svg`
3. **Favicon**: Upload `favicon.ico`

#### Set Brand Colors:
- **Primary Brand Color**: #1E40AF (or extract from your logos)
