**Post:**
Hey r/programming! 

After months of development, I'm excited to share **RinaWarp Terminal** - a modern terminal that brings AI assistance, voice control, and beautiful themes to your development workflow.

## What makes it special:

**🤖 AI Assistant:** Natural language command help and error explanations
- "How do I revert the last 3 git commits?"
- Explains what went wrong when commands fail
- Suggests optimizations for your workflow

**🎤 Voice Control:** 
- "Hey Rina, show me my Git status"
- "Create a new branch called feature-auth"
- Works great for when your hands are full or during pair programming

**🎨 Themes That Inspire:**
- 50+ carefully crafted themes
- Signature "Mermaid" theme with oceanic vibes
- Dark/light modes with customizable accents
- Actually makes you want to use the terminal

**⚡ Performance:**
- 40% faster command execution
- Efficient resource usage
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Free vs Pro:

**FREE (Always):**
- Full terminal with advanced features
- 6 beautiful themes including Mermaid
- 3 tabs and split panes
- Basic AI (20 queries/day)

**PRO ($15/month):**
- Unlimited AI queries
- Voice commands
- Cloud sync across devices
- All 50+ themes
- Priority support

## The Story:
I was frustrated with existing terminals being stuck in the 90s while everything else evolved. Developers deserve tools that are both powerful AND enjoyable to use. 

The AI isn't just gimmicky - it genuinely saves time. Instead of googling "git undo commit" for the 100th time, just ask Rina.
