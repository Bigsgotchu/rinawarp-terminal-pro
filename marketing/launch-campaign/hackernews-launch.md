# RinaWarp Terminal - Hacker News Launch Post

**Title:** Show HN: RinaWarp Terminal â€“ AI-powered terminal with voice control and 50+ themes

**Post:**
Hi HN!

I've been working on RinaWarp Terminal for several months - a terminal that brings AI assistance and voice control to the command line without sacrificing the power that developers need.

**Demo:** https://rinawarptech.com
**Source:** https://github.com/Rinawarp-Terminal/rinawarp-terminal

## Why I built this:

The terminal is the most-used developer tool, but it's essentially unchanged since the 90s. While IDEs evolved with IntelliSense and AI assistance, terminals remained static. I wanted to bridge that gap.

## Technical approach:

- **Local AI processing** for privacy and speed
- **Electron-based** for cross-platform consistency  
- **Voice recognition** using Web Speech API
- **Theme engine** supporting 50+ carefully crafted themes
- **Plugin architecture** (upcoming) for extensibility

## Key features:

**AI Assistant:**
- Natural language to command translation
- Context-aware error explanations  
- Command optimization suggestions
- Works offline after initial setup

**Voice Control:**
- "Hey Rina, show my Git status"
- "Create a new branch called feature-auth" 
- Useful during pair programming or when hands are occupied

**Themes & UX:**
- 50+ themes including signature "Mermaid" theme
- Multiple tabs and split panes
- 40% faster performance than most terminals
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Business model:

- **Free tier:** Full terminal with 6 themes, basic AI (20 queries/day)
- **Pro tier:** $15/month for unlimited AI, voice commands, all themes, cloud sync

The free tier is genuinely useful - not just a trial. Want developers to have access regardless of budget.

## Questions for HN:

1. What would make you switch terminals?
2. Is voice control in terminals actually useful or just novelty?
3. What AI features would be most valuable in your workflow?

Excited to hear your thoughts and feedback!

**Founder background:** Full-stack developer, frustrated terminal user, believer in developer happiness.
