Title: "Built an AI terminal that saves me 5+ hours/week - now in beta"

Hey r/webdev!

After getting frustrated with switching between ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and my terminal, I built RinaWarp Terminal - an AI-powered terminal that understands natural language commands.

**Instead of:**
1. Describe problem in ChatGPT
2. Copy code to terminal
3. Debug and iterate
4. Go back to ChatGPT
5. Repeat...

**Now:**
"Create a React login component with form validation" ‚Üí Generates, implements, and tests automatically.

**Beta Results:**
- 40% faster development (measured across 50+ users)
- Context aware of your entire codebase
- Works with GPT-4, Claude, Groq, and local models

**Beta Program:**
Taking 100 beta users at $19/month (early bird pricing).
Would love feedback from this community.

Subject: Would love your feedback on my AI terminal tool

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I've been working on something that I think you'd find interesting.

I built an AI-powered terminal called RinaWarp Terminal that eliminates the need to switch between ChatGPT and your terminal. You just type natural language commands and it executes them.

Example: "Create a React login component with validation" ‚Üí It generates, implements, and tests the code automatically.

I'm launching a limited beta (100 users) and would love your feedback. Early beta users are seeing 40% faster development cycles.

If you're interested, here's the link: [BETA_LINK]
(Early bird pricing: $19/month instead of regular $39/month)

No worries if it's not relevant, but thought you might find it useful!

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - Happy to jump on a quick call to demo it if you're curious

### **Cold Outreach to Developers**
```
Subject: How [Company] developers could ship features 40% faster

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're a [Role] at [Company] working with [Technology]. 

I built an AI development assistant that's helping developers like you ship features significantly faster by eliminating context switching between AI chat interfaces and terminals.

**Quick results:**
- Sarah (Stripe): "Saves 3+ hours daily"
- Marcus (Shopify): "40% faster feature development"
- Alex (Y Combinator startup): "Best dev tool investment"

**What makes it different:**
Unlike ChatGPT or Copilot, RinaWarp Terminal understands your entire project context and executes natural language commands directly in your workflow.

I'm running a limited beta (100 users) with early bird pricing ($19/month vs regular $39/month).

Would you be interested in a 5-minute demo to see if it could help [Company]'s development velocity?

If not, no worries ‚Äì just thought it might be relevant.

Best regards,
[Your name]
