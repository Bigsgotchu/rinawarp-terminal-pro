Hey r/programming! 

Just launched my AI terminal app after months of development. It brings voice commands and intelligent automation to your terminal workflow.

**Key features:**
• Voice-to-command translation
• Context-aware automation

Would love feedback from fellow developers! Any suggestions for features or improvements?

Built this because I was tired of repetitive terminal tasks. RinaWarp understands your intent and helps you work faster.

What do you think? Does this solve a pain point for you?
