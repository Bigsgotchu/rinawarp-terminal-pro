**Email:**
Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well at [Company]! 

I've been building something I think you'd find interesting - RinaWarp Terminal. It's an AI-powered terminal with voice control that I've been working on for months.

Key features:
‚Ä¢ Voice commands: "Hey Rina, show my Git status"
‚Ä¢ AI that explains errors and suggests commands  
‚Ä¢ 50+ beautiful themes (finally!)
‚Ä¢ 40% faster performance
‚Ä¢ Cross-platform

I remember you mentioning how much time you spent in terminals at [Previous Company], so thought you might appreciate this.

Would you mind:
1. Checking out the early access signup: [your-signup-link]
2. Sharing with any developer friends who might be interested?

No pressure at all - just excited to share what I've been building!

Thanks!
[Your name]

P.S. Launching next week - would love your feedback if you get a chance to try it!
