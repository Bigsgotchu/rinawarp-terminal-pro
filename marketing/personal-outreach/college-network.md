**Subject:** From dorm room coding to AI terminals - check out what I built! üéì

**Email:**
Hey [Name]!

Hope you're crushing it in [their current role/city]! 

Remember those late nights in [dorm/computer lab] coding on those ancient terminals? Well, I've been building the terminal I wish we had back then.

RinaWarp Terminal features:
‚Ä¢ AI assistance for commands (no more Stack Overflow for basic stuff!)
‚Ä¢ Voice control for hands-free coding
‚Ä¢ Actually beautiful themes
‚Ä¢ Cross-platform support

It's launching next week and I'm looking for early testers from my [University] network.

Early access: [your-signup-link]

Would love if you could:
1. Sign up and try it out
2. Share with other [University] alums in tech
3. Let me know what you think!

Hope we can catch up soon - would love to hear about [their current work]!

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Still remember you teaching me [specific technical skill] - that knowledge went into building this! üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Personalization Tips:**
- Mention specific professors, classes, or projects
- Reference shared dorm/campus experiences
