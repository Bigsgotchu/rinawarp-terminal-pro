💬 FIRST COMMENT (paste this after submission):
-----------------------------------------------
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Karina, and I'm excited to finally share RinaWarp Terminal with the community!

🤔 **The Problem**: As developers, we spend hours daily in terminals, but most haven't evolved since the 1980s. We're still typing the same git commands, switching between countless tabs, and staring at ugly green-on-black interfaces.

✨ **Our Solution**: RinaWarp Terminal combines three game-changers:

🧠 **AI that learns YOUR workflow** - Not generic suggestions, but patterns specific to your projects
🎤 **Voice control that actually works** - "Hey Rina, deploy to staging" and it happens
🧜‍♀️ **Beautiful mermaid themes** - Hot pink and teal that don't hurt your eyes after 8+ hours

🚀 **What makes us different**:
- AI suggestions get smarter as you use it
- Voice commands work offline with ElevenLabs integration
- Built for teams from day one (shared configs, collaboration)
- Cross-platform: Web, Mac, Windows, Linux

💝 **Special for PH community**: Try our free plan forever, or use code PRODUCTHUNT for 50% off your first month!

What terminal frustrations drive you crazy? I'd love to hear how RinaWarp could help your workflow!

Thanks for the support! 🙌
