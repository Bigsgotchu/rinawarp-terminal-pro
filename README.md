### Plugin Development
The plugin system is designed to be extensible. Each plugin can register hooks for:
- `terminal-created`: When a new terminal is created
- `directory-changed`: When the working directory changes
- `command-suggestion`: For providing command suggestions

Example plugin structure:
```javascript
class MyPlugin {
    constructor() {
        this.hooks = {
            'terminal-created': this.onTerminalCreated.bind(this)
        };
    }
    
    async onTerminalCreated(terminalData) {
        // Your plugin logic here
    }
}
```
