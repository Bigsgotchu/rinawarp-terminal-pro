Title: [50% OFF Launch] RinaWarp Terminal - AI-powered developer terminal with real-time suggestions

Body:
Hey r/programming!

I'm excited to share a new developer tool I've been working on: RinaWarp Terminal - an AI-powered terminal that helps developers code faster and smarter.

**What it does:**
- Real-time AI code suggestions as you type
- Deep project intelligence (analyzes your entire codebase)
- Workflow automation with AI detection
- Advanced code visualization
- Natural language commands

We just launched, and to celebrate, we're offering **50% off** for the first 100 users (normally $19.99/month, now $9.99/month).

Here's a quick demo: [GIF LINK]

I'd love to hear your feedback if you try it out! What AI features would you want in your terminal?
