## 🚨 Important Notes

- **No AI Provider Required**: The integration includes intelligent mock responses for demonstration
- **Real AI Integration**: To connect to actual AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), update the `callAIProvider` method in `warp-agent-integration.js`
- **Privacy**: All your existing privacy settings and data handling remain unchanged
- **Performance**: The integration is lightweight and won't slow down your terminal

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding Real AI Provider

Replace the mock responses in `src/ai-system/warp-agent-integration.js`:

```javascript
async callAIProvider(query, context) {
  // Replace this section with your actual AI provider
  const response = await fetch('your-ai-endpoint', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, context })
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

### Styling Customization

The agent panel automatically inherits your RinaWarp theme. To further customize:

```javascript
// In createAgentInterface() method
agentPanel.style.cssText = `
  /* Add your custom styles here */
  background: your-custom-gradient;
  border: your-custom-border;
`;
```

## 📞 Support

If you need help with the integration:

1. Check the browser console for any error messages
2. Verify all files are in the correct locations
3. Ensure your terminal is fully loaded before running the integration
