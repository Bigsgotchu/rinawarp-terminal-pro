## Maker Comment Template
"👋 Hey Product Hunt! I'm the maker of RinaWarp Terminal.

After getting frustrated with outdated terminal experiences, I spent months building the terminal I always wanted - one with AI assistance, voice commands, and beautiful design.

The AI learns your workflow patterns and suggests commands, while the voice integration lets you literally say 'Hey Rina, deploy to production' and it happens!
