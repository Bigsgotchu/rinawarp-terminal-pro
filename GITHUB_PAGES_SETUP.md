# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Setup

## Current Status
Your RinaWarp Terminal project is now ready for GitHub Pages deployment with your enterprise GitHub account.

## ✅ What's Done
1. **Simplified GitHub Pages workflow** created at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
2. **CNAME file** created at `public/CNAME` pointing to `rinawarptech.com`
3. **Deployment script** created at `scripts/deploy-github-pages.js`
4. **All changes committed and pushed** to the main branch

## 🔧 Required Actions

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Rinawarp-Terminal/rinawarp-terminal
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**
3. Set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Set **Branch** to "main"
5. Set **Custom domain** to "rinawarptech.com"
6. Enable **Enforce HTTPS**
7. Click **Save**

### 2. Update DNS Records in Cloudflare
You need to change your DNS records from Firebase to GitHub Pages:

**Remove existing records:**
- Remove the A record pointing to `199.36.158.100` (Firebase)

**Add new records:**
- **A record 1**: Name: `@`, Value: `185.199.108.153`, TTL: Auto
- **A record 2**: Name: `@`, Value: `185.199.109.153`, TTL: Auto  
- **A record 3**: Name: `@`, Value: `185.199.110.153`, TTL: Auto
- **A record 4**: Name: `@`, Value: `185.199.111.153`, TTL: Auto
- **CNAME record**: Name: `www`, Value: `rinawarptech.com`, TTL: Auto

### 3. Manual Deployment Trigger
Since the workflow automation may have issues with enterprise accounts, you can manually trigger deployments:

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build:web
git add .
git commit -m "deploy: update website"
git push origin main
```

Then manually trigger the workflow in GitHub Actions or wait for the push trigger.

## 🌐 URLs After Setup
- **GitHub Pages URL**: https://rinawarp-terminal.github.io/rinawarp-terminal
- **Custom domain**: https://rinawarptech.com (after DNS propagation)
- **Download links**: Will work from `/releases/` directory

## 📊 Monitoring
- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/Rinawarp-Terminal/rinawarp-terminal/actions
- **Pages Settings**: https://github.com/Rinawarp-Terminal/rinawarp-terminal/settings/pages

## 🔍 Troubleshooting
If the deployment doesn't work:
1. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
2. Verify DNS records have propagated: `dig rinawarptech.com`
3. Check GitHub Actions logs for any errors
4. Ensure the `public/CNAME` file exists and contains `rinawarptech.com`

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Complete the DNS changes in Cloudflare
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Wait 10-15 minutes for DNS propagation
4. Test the deployment at https://rinawarptech.com
5. Verify download links work correctly

## 📈 Revenue Impact
Once deployed, your RinaWarp Terminal will be:
- ✅ Live at rinawarptech.com
- ✅ Download links working
- ✅ Ready for customer traffic
- ✅ Monitored by your analytics scripts
