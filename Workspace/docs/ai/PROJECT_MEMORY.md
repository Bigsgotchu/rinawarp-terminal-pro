# RinaWarp Project Memory (Local Guardrails)

## Golden Rules
- Never run destructive deletes unless Karina types: YES DELETE
- Never continue after a failed command; stop and fix the error first
- Always confirm cwd + repo root before build scripts
- Never create or use mirrored folders (.vscode copies, nested apps paths)

## Golden Commands
- ./scripts/prove-build.sh
- ./scripts/deploy-readiness.sh
