# Download Redirects Solution

## Problem

The download links on the website were redirecting to a Railway API that was expecting actual download files (executables, installers, etc.) to be available. However, these files were not present on the Railway server, causing 404 "File not found" errors when users tried to download RinaWarp Terminal.

### Original Error
```json
{
  "error": "File not found",
  "message": "The requested file \"RinaWarp-Terminal-Setup-Windows.exe\" is not available for download.",
  "traceId": "unknown"
}
```

## Root Cause

1. **Missing Files**: The Railway API was configured to serve download files from either:
   - Local filesystem (`/public/releases/` or `/public/`)
   - GitHub releases (https://github.com/Rinawarp-Terminal/rinawarp-terminal/releases)

2. **Non-existent GitHub Repository**: The GitHub repository `Rinawarp-Terminal/rinawarp-terminal` either doesn't exist or doesn't have releases with the expected files.

3. **Parameter Mismatch**: The original redirects were sending `platform=windows&type=installer` parameters, but the Railway API expected `file=filename` parameters.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Redirect to Downloads Page
Updated `vercel.json` to redirect all download URLs to the downloads page with appropriate query parameters:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Setup-Windows.exe",
      "destination": "/downloads.html?file=windows-installer"
    },
    {
      "source": "/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Portable-Windows.exe",
      "destination": "/downloads.html?file=windows-portable"
    },
    {
      "source": "/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Setup-macOS.dmg",
      "destination": "/downloads.html?file=macos-installer"
    },
    {
      "source": "/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Linux.deb",
      "destination": "/downloads.html?file=linux-deb"
    },
    {
      "source": "/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Linux.rpm",
      "destination": "/downloads.html?file=linux-rpm"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Downloads Page
Added JavaScript to `downloads.html` to:

- **Detect query parameters** for specific file types
- **Show notifications** when users arrive via redirect
- **Display "Coming Soon" modals** when download buttons are clicked
- **Provide user-friendly messaging** about the status of downloads

### 3. User Experience Features

#### Redirect Notifications
When users click download links, they see a notification in the top-right corner:
> 🧜‍♀️ **Windows Installer** is coming soon!  
> Files are being prepared for release

#### Download Button Modals
When users click download buttons on the page, they see a centered modal:
> 🧜‍♀️ **Coming Soon!**  
> 
> RinaWarp Terminal download files are being prepared.  
> Check back soon for the latest releases!

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: No more 404 errors on download links  
✅ **User-Friendly**: Clear messaging about download availability  
✅ **SEO-Friendly**: Proper redirects maintain link juice  
✅ **Deployed**: Live on https://www.rinawarptech.com

## Next Steps

To provide actual downloads, you can:

1. **Create GitHub Releases**:
   - Set up the GitHub repository `Rinawarp-Terminal/rinawarp-terminal`
   - Upload built executables to releases
   - The Railway API will automatically serve them

2. **Update Railway API**:
   - Upload files directly to Railway's file system
   - Place files in `/public/releases/` directory

3. **Alternative Hosting**:
   - Host files on a CDN or file storage service
   - Update redirects to point to the actual download URLs

## Files Modified

- `vercel.json`: Updated redirects to point to downloads page
- `public/downloads.html`: Enhanced with JavaScript for query parameter handling and notifications

## Testing

All redirect URLs now properly redirect to the downloads page:
- ✅ `/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Setup-Windows.exe` → `/downloads.html?file=windows-installer`
- ✅ `/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Portable-Windows.exe` → `/downloads.html?file=windows-portable`
- ✅ `/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Setup-macOS.dmg` → `/downloads.html?file=macos-installer`
- ✅ `/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Linux.deb` → `/downloads.html?file=linux-deb`
- ✅ `/releases/RinaWarp-Terminal-Linux.rpm` → `/downloads.html?file=linux-rpm`

Users now get a proper landing page with clear messaging instead of JSON error responses.
