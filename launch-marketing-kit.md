### 🎪 **Product Hunt Strategy**

#### **Maker Comment Template**
```
🧜‍♀️ Maker here! 

Thanks everyone for the support! RinaWarp Terminal has been a passion project for months.

**What inspired this:**
Terminals haven't evolved much in decades. Still ugly, basic, frustrating. As developers, we deserve better tools.

**What's special:**
- AI that actually helps (not just autocomplete)
- Voice control that works ("create React component UserProfile")
- Themes that don't hurt your eyes
- Enterprise features for teams

**Just launched with payments and already seeing incredible response!**

AMA about building this! 🚀

#### **Update Comments**
```
🔥 UPDATE: Just got our first paying customer! 

The AI suggestions are getting smarter with each user. Voice control is the game-changer - once you try "git commit -m 'fix user auth bug'" by voice, you can't go back! 

Thanks for all the support hunters! 🧜‍♀️
```

### 🎬 **Video Script (if making demo)**
```
"Hi! I'm excited to show you RinaWarp Terminal.

[Screen: Terminal opening with beautiful theme]

This isn't just another terminal. Watch this:

[Voice command]: "Create a React component called UserProfile"
[Shows AI generating the component]

Or this: "Show me my git status and recent commits"  
[Shows intelligent git summary]

The AI learns your workflow. Beautiful themes. Enterprise security.

It's live now at rinawarptech.com/pricing starting at $15/month.

Much less than other developer tools, way more intelligent.

Check it out! 🧜‍♀️"
