## ðŸ“§ EMAIL #1: Personal Network Launch

**Subject:** I just launched my AI terminal app - would love your feedback!

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something exciting with you.

After months of development, I just launched **RinaWarp Terminal** - an AI-powered terminal that actually makes developers more productive.

**What makes it different:**
- AI learns your command patterns and suggests completions
- Beautiful themes (including our signature Mermaid theme with hot pink & teal)
- Split-pane functionality that doesn't suck
- Session management that survives crashes
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Why I built it:**
I was tired of typing the same git commands over and over, switching between terminal tabs, and dealing with ugly interfaces. So I built the terminal I always wanted.

**Try it free:** https://rinawarp-terminal.vercel.app

**Would love your feedback!** Even if you're not a developer, I'd appreciate you checking it out and letting me know what you think.

If you know any developers who might be interested, I'd be grateful if you could share it with them!

Thanks for being awesome,
[Your name]

P.S. The AI actually learns from your usage patterns - it's pretty cool to see it get smarter over time!
