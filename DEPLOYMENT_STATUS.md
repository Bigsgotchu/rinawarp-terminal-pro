### 🚀 Launch Readiness

**The application is PRODUCTION READY with the following caveats:**

1. **For Developer Release**: ✅ READY
   - All core features working
   - AI integration functional
   - Build system operational

2. **For Public Release**: ⚠️ NEEDS CODE SIGNING
   - Requires code signing for trusted distribution
   - Consider implementing auto-updater
   - Add user onboarding flow

### 📊 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Development
npm start                    # Run in development mode
npm run dev:full            # Run with all dev features

# Production
npm run build               # Build for current platform
npm run build:all          # Build for all platforms
npm run build:releases     # Package releases

# Testing
npm test                    # Run tests
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests
```

### 🔗 Integration Status

| Service | Status | Configuration |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Anthropic AI | ✅ Working | API key in .env |
| ElevenLabs | ✅ Configured | API key in .env |
| Stripe | ✅ Live Keys | Production keys set |
