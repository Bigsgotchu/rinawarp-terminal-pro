# ✅ GitHub Actions Setup Complete

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Automated Workflows Added
1. **Continuous Integration (CI)** - `ci.yml`
   - Triggers: Push to any branch, Pull Requests
   - Purpose: Quick validation, testing, security checks
   - Status: ✅ **ACTIVE**

2. **Build and Release** - `build-and-release.yml`
   - Triggers: Manual, Push to main/develop branches
   - Purpose: Cross-platform builds with artifacts
   - Status: ✅ **ACTIVE**

3. **Nightly Builds** - `nightly.yml`
   - Triggers: Daily at 2 AM UTC, Manual
   - Purpose: Development builds with change detection
   - Status: ✅ **ACTIVE**

4. **Release** - `release.yml`
   - Triggers: Git tags (v*.*.*)
   - Purpose: Production releases with comprehensive notes
   - Status: ✅ **ACTIVE**

### ✅ Code Signing Configuration
- **Windows**: Self-signed certificates (development ready)
- **Linux**: No signing required
- **macOS**: Unsigned (production certificates needed)

### ✅ Release Triggered
- Created and pushed tag `v1.0.3`
- This should trigger the Release workflow
- Expected: Cross-platform builds with automated release notes

## 🔐 Secrets Status

### Current Setup (Development)
```
Status: ✅ READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
- Windows: Self-signed certificates (auto-generated)
- Linux: No signing required
- macOS: Unsigned builds (will show security warnings)
```

### Production Setup (Todo)
```
Status: ⏳ PENDING CERTIFICATES
Required for production distribution:

WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE         # Base64 PFX file (~$300-500/year)
WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
MACOS_CERTIFICATE           # Base64 P12 file (~$99/year)
MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
APPLE_ID                    # For notarization
APPLE_ID_PASSWORD           # App-specific password
APPLE_TEAM_ID              # Developer team ID
```

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. ✅ **Monitor CI workflow completion**
2. ✅ **Monitor Release workflow completion**
3. ✅ **Download and test built artifacts**
4. ✅ **Verify Windows code signing works**

### Short-term (This week)
- [ ] **Test all platform builds** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] **Verify executable functionality**
- [ ] **Test installation processes**
- [ ] **Plan production certificate purchase**

### Medium-term (This month)
- [ ] **Purchase Windows code signing certificate**
- [ ] **Setup Apple Developer account**
- [ ] **Configure production secrets**
- [ ] **Test production release process**

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If CI Workflow Fails
1. Check workflow logs in Actions tab
2. Common issues: Node.js version, dependency conflicts
3. Review `ci.yml` for configuration issues

### If Release Workflow Fails
1. Check build logs for each platform
2. macOS builds may fail due to missing certificates (expected)
3. Windows builds should succeed with self-signed certificates
4. Linux builds should succeed without signing

### If No Workflows Trigger
1. Check repository permissions
2. Verify workflow file syntax (YAML)
3. Ensure push reached GitHub (check commit history)
