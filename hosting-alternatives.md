## 🎯 Quick Fix Recommendation

### Option A: Switch to Netlify (Fastest)
1. Sign up at netlify.com
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Set build command to: `echo "Static site"`
4. Set publish directory to: `public`
5. Deploy!

### Option B: Fix Firebase (Already set up)
1. Your Firebase is already configured
2. Just need to ensure custom domain points to Firebase
3. Deploy with: `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### Option C: Use GitHub Pages (Free)
1. Your workflow is already set up
2. Just enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
3. Point custom domain to GitHub Pages

## 🔧 Quick Deploy Script

I can create a deploy script that works with any of these platforms:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Universal deploy script
echo "🚀 Deploying RinaWarp Terminal..."

# Option 1: Netlify
if command -v netlify &> /dev/null; then
    echo "📦 Deploying to Netlify..."
    netlify deploy --prod --dir=public
fi

# Option 2: Firebase
if command -v firebase &> /dev/null; then
    echo "🔥 Deploying to Firebase..."
    firebase deploy --only hosting
fi

# Option 3: GitHub Pages (via git push)
echo "📄 Pushing to GitHub Pages..."
git add -A
git commit -m "Deploy: $(date)"
git push origin main
```

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Use Netlify** - It's the most straightforward for your use case:
1. No build system conflicts
2. Perfect for static sites with large files
3. Simple configuration
4. Fast deployment
5. Great CDN for download speeds

Would you like me to set up deployment to Netlify or fix your existing Firebase setup?
