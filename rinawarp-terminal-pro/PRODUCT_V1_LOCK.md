Ship a trustworthy execution agent that diagnoses and fixes real system problems via chat.

v1 Includes:
- Chat-first interaction (no buttons required)
- System Doctor (diagnose → propose → confirm → execute → verify)
- Streaming output
- Cancel anytime
- Typed YES for high-impact actions
- Full audit transcript + export
- Local-first operation

v1 Explicitly Excludes:
- Autonomous background agents
- Multi-user sync
- Plugin marketplace
- Voice-first UX

North Star Test:
If a change does not improve trust, safety, or real-world execution,
it does not ship in v1.
