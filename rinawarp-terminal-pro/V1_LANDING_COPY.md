## HERO SECTION (ABOVE THE FOLD)

### Headline

**The First AI You Can Trust to Actually Fix Things**

### Subheadline

Talk to Rina like ChatGPT.
She inspects your system, proves what's wrong, asks before making changes, fixes it safely, and shows you exactly what happened.

### Primary CTA

**Download RinaWarp Terminal Pro**

### Secondary CTA

Watch a live fix (2 min)

## SHORT PROBLEM STATEMENT (IMMEDIATELY AFTER HERO)

Most AI tools talk.
Most terminals execute.

Neither are safe enough to do both.

Developers and power users are stuck:

- ChatGPT explains but can't act
- Automation tools act but can't be trusted
- One mistake can destroy a system

So people bounce between tools, scripts, terminals, and guesswork.

## THE RINAWARP SOLUTION (CORE DIFFERENTIATOR)

### What Rina Does Differently

RinaWarp is not "another AI app."

Rina is an execution partner.

She follows one strict contract:

1. You describe the problem in natural language
2. Rina inspects your system (read-only first)
3. She shows evidence and explains what's wrong
4. She proposes fixes — ranked by risk
5. You approve in plain language
6. Rina executes transparently
7. She verifies the result and reports back

**No hidden steps.**
**No silent changes.**
**No blind automation.**

---

## LIVE EXAMPLE (THIS SELLS HARD)

### Example: "My computer is running hot"

**You say:**

> My computer is running hot

**Rina responds:**

1. Runs safe diagnostics (CPU, processes, temperature)
2. Shows what's causing the issue
3. Explains why it matters
4. Proposes the safest fix
5. Before doing anything, she asks:
   > "If you want me to apply this fix, reply: run it  
   > For high-impact actions, type YES."
6. After execution:
   - Output streams live
   - Results are verified
   - A full audit report is saved

**This is what trust looks like.**
