# Fixing OpenAI Quota Issues

## Understanding the Error
The error "You exceeded your current quota" means one of the following:
1. You've used all your free trial credits
2. You haven't added a payment method
3. You've hit your monthly spending limit

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Check Your Current Usage
Visit: https://platform.openai.com/usage

This will show:
- Current balance
- Usage this month
- Remaining credits

### 2. Add Payment Method
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/settings/billing/payment-methods
2. Click "Add payment method"
3. Enter your card details
4. Set a monthly spending limit (start with $5-10)

### 3. Check Rate Limits
Visit: https://platform.openai.com/settings/limits

You might be hitting:
- Requests per minute (RPM) limits
- Tokens per minute (TPM) limits

## Alternative Solutions

### Use Anthropic Instead
If you don't want to add billing to OpenAI yet:

1. **Get Anthropic API Key**:
   - Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com/
   - They often have a more generous free tier
   - Add to your `.env`: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`

2. **Update your code** to use Anthropic as default:
   ```javascript
   // In your API calls, specify provider
   {
     "prompt": "Your prompt",
     "provider": "anthropic"
   }
   ```

### Use a Proxy Service
Services like OpenRouter let you access multiple AI providers with one API:
- https://openrouter.ai/
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Access to many models

## Cost Management Tips

### For OpenAI:
- GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens (very cheap)
- GPT-4: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens (more expensive)
- Set a monthly limit of $5-10 to start

### Estimating Costs:
- 1K tokens ≈ 750 words
- Average request: 500-1000 tokens
- $5 budget ≈ 2,500 requests with GPT-3.5-turbo

### Reduce Costs:
1. Use GPT-3.5-turbo instead of GPT-4
2. Limit max_tokens in responses
3. Cache common requests
4. Implement user quotas

## Testing with Mock Mode
While fixing quota issues, your service will use mock responses. This is fine for:
- Testing deployment
- Frontend development
- API structure validation

## Next Steps
1. **Add payment method** to OpenAI (recommended)
2. **Or get Anthropic key** as alternative
3. **Deploy your service** - it will work with mock responses
4. **Add real AI** once you have working keys
